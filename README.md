# Jetson_project_mask

Using the platform of Jetson Nano, and the instruction it has given, I changed the topic of thumbs up and down to be masks on and off.
Since Covid-19 requires everyone to weak masks at certian locations, testing if one wears a mask or not is necessary. 

**The Steps:

**1. Testing the connection of the camera

**2. Create dataset and categories, also the path to them

**3. Choose the model for it, in this case, we use RESNET 18

**4. Create the screen to take the picture and train

**5. TRAINING!!!!
